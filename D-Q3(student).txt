.3.Design and develop SQL DDL and DML statements to manage the Student database (students, courses, and enrollments with grades).
Also execute queries for following:
1.	Find average grade (convert A=4, B=3, etc.) per course.
2.	List students alphabetically by name.
3.	Find students enrolled in the course “Database Systems”.
4.	Delete a course if no students are enrolled.
5.	Display all students who scored grade 'A'.

1) Find average grade per course (A=4, B=3, C=2, D=1, F=0)
SELECT c.course_name,

       ) AS avg_grade
FROM Enrollment e
JOIN Course c ON e.course_id = c.course_id

2) List students alphabetically by name
SELECT * FROM Student
ORDER BY name ASC;

3) Find students enrolled in “Database Systems”
SELECT s.name
FROM Student s
JOIN Enrollment e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
JOIN Course c ON e.course_id = c.course_id
WHERE c.course_name = 'Database Systems';



4) Delete a course if no students are enrolled
DELETE FROM Course
WHERE course_id NOT IN (SELECT course_id FROM Enrollment);

5) Display all students who scored grade 'A'
SELECT s.name, c.course_name
FROM Student s
JOIN Enrollment e ON s.student_id = e.student_id
JOIN Course c ON e.course_id = c.course_id
WHERE e.grade = 'A';
